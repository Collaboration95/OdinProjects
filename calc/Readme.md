> Status: Completed

> Calc By Me  was coded using Html , CSS and Javascript

### Features
- Supports Keyboard Input
- Handles PEMDAS Operations
- Displays + Stores Operation History (1 level) 

This is a project that i made under the OdinProject Curriculum.
I really had fun picking out the accent and tonal colors and minimalistic calculator design. This color pallete is a step up from my previous project's monochrome color choice.

### Challenges I Encountered :
-  I had a difficult time coding the project  to react the same way to to keyboard input as physically clicking the buttons with a mouse , but with the help of time out function i was able to approximate the effects !

Here's a live demo ðŸ‘‰ [Calc By Me](https://collaboration95.github.io/OdinProjects/calc/)

take a gander (ð“…¬) , Its optimised for mobile viewing as well !
