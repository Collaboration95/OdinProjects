# Rock Paper Scissors
This is a project that i am currently making under the OdinProject Curriculum

### Requirements 

You should round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen.

EXTRA CREDIT: Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5. It is hard to do math on these numbers. (disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display)

EXTRA CREDIT: Make it look nice! This is a great project to practice your CSS skills. At least make the operations a different color from the keypad buttons.
